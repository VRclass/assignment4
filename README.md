# ATS ARTTECH 4135-001: Virtual Reality

## assignment4 VRTK and SteamVR



>VRTK offers a VR Simulator that works without any third party SDK, but VR device support requires a supported VR SDK to be imported into the Unity project.

In this assignment you will start with the github classroom link, work on your **assignment2** repository, download package to your computer, make modifications to the unity project, commit the changes, and push back the updated repository to github.
